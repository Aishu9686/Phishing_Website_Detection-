# ðŸŽ¯ Phishing Website Detection

Phishing Website Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying whether a given website is legitimate or a phishing attempt based on its URL and other extracted features. This project can help prevent users from falling victim to online fraud by analyzing URLs and classifying them in real-time.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Machine Learning models for classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Feature extraction from URLs (length, use of special characters, IP address, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
- Interactive Web Application using Streamlit (optional).
- Clean and well-documented code for easy understanding.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Frameworks: Django (API Development)
- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: SQLite/MySQL.

##  System Workflow

- Feature Extraction : Key attributes are extracted from the input URL, including lexical, host-based, and page-based features.
- Data Preprocessing : Collected data is cleaned and transformed for model training and evaluation.
- Classification : Trained models classify URLs as legitimate or phishing based on predefined parameters.

##  Project Objectives 

- Enhance cybersecurity by mitigating phishing threats effectively.
- Provide a scalable, open-source solution for real-world applications.
- Leverage machine learning to adapt to evolving phishing techniques.
